Organizational Configuration Repo

The primary goal of this layer is to add optimizations/configuration
options/recipes that are specific to your organization into this layer
to plug into the NI Linux RT image build system in a clean, segregated
manner.

There are many excellent resources online on how to create contents for
a layer, including documentation from Yocto and OpenEmbedded.
